# The POSCAR of the pure system for which the DOS has been 
# determined should be included in the directory. The DOS
# should be present in a file 'totdos.dat' with the energy 
# scaled relative to the top of the VBM (or the Fermi level 
# for a metal)
#
# Enter whether system is spin polarised or not (for reading in
# the DOS)
# 1 = non-spin polarised; 2 = spin polarised
#
1
#
# Now input number of electrons in pure unit cell using which the 
# DOS has been calculated
#
18
#
# Next enter the energy gap (eV)
#
0.8084
#
# Now enter temperature (K)

300 
#
# Number of defect species considered in your system
#
2
#
# For each defect species enter the name, number of charge states
# and number of possible sites for that defect in the unit cell
# (on one line), then the charge, formation energy (at E_F = 0)
# and degeneracy on subsequent lines.
# The degeneracy can be derived from the number of possible electron
# configurations for a defect in a particular charge state, including
# spin degeneracy and degeneracy due to possible localisation in 
# different configurations
