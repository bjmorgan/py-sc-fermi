abstract  ="The Shockley–Queisser (SQ) limit provides a convenient metric for predicting light-to-electricity conversion efficiency of a solar cell based on the band gap of the light-absorbing layer. In reality{,} few materials approach this radiative limit. We develop a formalism and computational method to predict the maximum photovoltaic efficiency of imperfect crystals from first principles. The trap-limited conversion efficiency includes equilibrium populations of native defects{,} their carrier-capture coefficients{,} and the associated recombination rates. When applied to kesterite solar cells{,} we reveal an intrinsic limit of 20% for Cu2ZnSnSe4{,} which falls far below the SQ limit of 32%. The effects of atomic substitution and extrinsic doping are studied{,} leading to pathways for an enhanced efficiency of 31%. This approach can be applied to support targeted-materials selection for future solar-energy technologies."}

	abstract = {The contribution emphasizes the central role of point defect chemistry for battery materials. While the significance for solid electrolytes is well appreciated, there are only a few examples, where defect chemistry is taken seriously for electrode materials. This is astonishing as it is only defect chemistry which allows for a proper understanding of both equilibrium (e.g. theoretical capacity, cell voltage) and non-equilibrium properties (losses due to transport problems, charge-transfer resistance, concentration polarization). Furthermore defect chemistry provides the framework for both a materials analysis and a materials search. Selected examples are discussed which refer to various storage modes, corroborating this statement (FePO4, Li2O2, TiO2, Ru: Li2O).}

abstract  ="Alloying is a common technique to optimize the functional properties of materials for thermoelectrics{,} photovoltaics{,} energy storage etc. Designing thermoelectric (TE) alloys is especially challenging because it is a multi-property optimization problem{,} where the properties that contribute to high TE performance are interdependent. In this work{,} we develop a computational framework that combines first-principles calculations with alloy and point defect modeling to identify alloy compositions that optimize the electronic{,} thermal{,} and defect properties. We apply this framework to design n-type Ba2(1−x)Sr2xCdP2 Zintl thermoelectric alloys. Our predictions of the crystallographic properties such as lattice parameters and site disorder are validated with experiments. To optimize the conduction band electronic structure{,} we perform band unfolding to sketch the effective band structures of alloys and find a range of compositions that facilitate band convergence and minimize alloy scattering of electrons. We assess the n-type dopability of the alloys by extending the standard approach for computing point defect energetics in ordered structures. Through the application of this framework{,} we identify an optimal alloy composition range with the desired electronic and thermal transport properties{,} and n-type dopability. Such a computational framework can also be used to design alloys for other functional applications beyond TE."}
