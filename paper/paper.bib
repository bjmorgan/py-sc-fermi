abstract  ="The Shockley–Queisser (SQ) limit provides a convenient metric for predicting light-to-electricity conversion efficiency of a solar cell based on the band gap of the light-absorbing layer. In reality{,} few materials approach this radiative limit. We develop a formalism and computational method to predict the maximum photovoltaic efficiency of imperfect crystals from first principles. The trap-limited conversion efficiency includes equilibrium populations of native defects{,} their carrier-capture coefficients{,} and the associated recombination rates. When applied to kesterite solar cells{,} we reveal an intrinsic limit of 20% for Cu2ZnSnSe4{,} which falls far below the SQ limit of 32%. The effects of atomic substitution and extrinsic doping are studied{,} leading to pathways for an enhanced efficiency of 31%. This approach can be applied to support targeted-materials selection for future solar-energy technologies."}

               electrolytes (SEs) is a prerequisite for the widespread usage of
               solid-state batteries. However, reported ionic conductivities of
               SEs exhibit significant variation even in materials with the
               same nominal composition. In this study, the thermodynamic
               origin of such sample-dependent variations is discussed using
               sodium-ion conducting Na3SbS4 as a model SE. The impact of
               uncontrolled variations in elemental chemical potentials on the
               ionic conductivity is investigated with theory and experiments.
               The elemental chemical potentials are uniquely defined when the
               system is constrained to have zero thermodynamic degrees of
               freedom. First, we establish the relationship between the
               chemical potentials and sodium-ion conductivity in Na3SbS4 by
               computing the phase diagram and native defect formation
               energies. From these calculations, we identify two distinct
               three-phase equilibrium regions (zero degrees of freedom) with
               the highest ratio of sodium-ion conductivity, which are then
               experimentally probed. Transport measurements reveal an abrupt
               change in the bulk ion transport of the phase-pure samples, with
               a room-temperature ionic conductivity of 0.16--1.2 mS cm--1 with
               a standard deviation of 50\% when the elemental chemical
               potentials are not controlled, that is, not uniquely defined. In
               contrast, we show that by controlling the chemical potentials
               and therefore, the defect formation energies through the
               experimental concept of phase boundary mapping, the
               sample-dependent variation is reduced to 15\% with a high
               average ionic conductivity of 0.94 mS cm--1. This study
               highlights the existence of ``hidden'' thermodynamic states
               defined by their chemical potentials and the need to precisely

While the significance for solid electrolytes is well appreciated, there are only a few examples, where defect chemistry is taken seriously for electrode materials. This is astonishing as it is only defect chemistry which allows for a proper understanding of both equilibrium (e.g. theoretical capacity, cell voltage) and non-equilibrium properties (losses due to transport problems, charge-transfer resistance, concentration polarization). Furthermore defect chemistry provides the framework for both a materials analysis and a materials search. Selected examples are discussed which refer to various storage modes, corroborating this statement (FePO4, Li2O2, TiO2, Ru: Li2O).}

              Mo-substituted iron oxides prepared by thermally activated
              co-precipitation. In the presence of Mo ions, we find that
              varying the oxidation state of the iron precursor from Fe(II) to
              Fe(III) causes a progressive loss of atomic long-range order with
              the stabilization of 2-4 nm particles for the sample prepared
              with Fe(III). The oxidation state of the Fe precursor also
              affects the distribution of Fe and Mo cations within the spinel
              structure. Increasing the Fe precursor oxidation state gives
              decreased Fe-ion occupation and increased Mo-ion occupation of
              tetrahedral sites, as revealed by the extended X-ray absorption
              fine structure. The stabilization of Mo within tetrahedral sites
              appears to be unexpected, considering the octahedral preferred
              coordination number of Mo(VI). The analysis of the atomic
              structure of the sample prepared with Fe(III) indicates a local
              ordering of vacancies and that the occupation of tetrahedral
              sites by Mo induces a contraction of the interatomic distances
              within the polyhedra as compared to Fe atoms. Moreover, the
              occupancy of Mo into the thermodynamic site preference of a Mo
              dopant in Fe2O3 assessed by density functional theory
              calculations points to a stronger preference for Mo substitution
              at octahedral sites. Hence, we suggest that the synthetized
              compound is thermodynamically metastable, that is, kinetically
              trapped. Such a state is suggested to be a consequence of the
              tetrahedral site occupation by Mo ions. The population of these
              sites, known to be reactive sites enabling particle growth, is
              concomitant with the stabilization of very small particles. We
              confirmed our hypothesis by using a blank experiment without Mo
              ions, further supporting the impact of tetrahedral Mo ions on the
              growth of iron oxide nanoparticles. Our findings provide new
              insights into the relationships between the Fe-chemistry of the

              population alters the material's properties. Modern first

              (DefAP), an open-source Python code, has been designed to fulfil
              this role. The primary function of the package is to predict the

              thermodynamic variables, such as temperature and availability of
              different species, expressed through chemical potentials. Through

abstract  ="Alloying is a common technique to optimize the functional properties of materials for thermoelectrics{,} photovoltaics{,} energy storage etc. Designing thermoelectric (TE) alloys is especially challenging because it is a multi-property optimization problem{,} where the properties that contribute to high TE performance are interdependent. In this work{,} we develop a computational framework that combines first-principles calculations with alloy and point defect modeling to identify alloy compositions that optimize the electronic{,} thermal{,} and defect properties. We apply this framework to design n-type Ba2(1−x)Sr2xCdP2 Zintl thermoelectric alloys. Our predictions of the crystallographic properties such as lattice parameters and site disorder are validated with experiments. To optimize the conduction band electronic structure{,} we perform band unfolding to sketch the effective band structures of alloys and find a range of compositions that facilitate band convergence and minimize alloy scattering of electrons. We assess the n-type dopability of the alloys by extending the standard approach for computing point defect energetics in ordered structures. Through the application of this framework{,} we identify an optimal alloy composition range with the desired electronic and thermal transport properties{,} and n-type dopability. Such a computational framework can also be used to design alloys for other functional applications beyond TE."}

  abstract  = "A deep understanding of defects is essential for the
               optimization of materials for solar energy conversion. This is
               particularly true for metal oxide photo(electro)catalysts, which
               typically feature high concentrations of charged point defects
               that are electronically active. In photovoltaic materials,
               except for selected dopants, defects are considered detrimental
               and should be eliminated to minimize charge recombination.
               However, photocatalysis is a more complex process in which
               defects can have an active role, such as in stabilizing charge
               separation and in mediating rate-limiting catalytic steps. In
               this Review, we examine the behaviour of electronic defects in
               metal oxides, paying special attention to the principles that
               underpin the formation and function of trapped charges in the
               form of polarons. We focus on how defects alter the electronic
               structure of metal oxides, statically or transiently upon
               illumination, and discuss the implications of such changes in
               light-driven catalytic reactions. Finally, we compare oxide
               defect chemistry with that of new photocatalysts based on carbon
               nitrides, polymers and metal halide perovskites. Defects have a
               key role in determining the functionality of solids and can make
               them powerful catalysts. This Review examines defect chemistry
               in metal oxides and discusses the role that charged defects and
               polarons have in enabling photoelectrochemical reactions.",

              Non-radiative electron-hole recombination reduces the solar
              conversion efficiency from an ideal value of 32\% to a current
              champion performance of 22\%. The cadmium vacancy (VCd) is a
              prominent acceptor species in p-type CdTe; however, debate
              continues regarding its structural and electronic behavior. Using
              ab initio defect techniques, we calculate a negative-U
              double-acceptor level for VCd, while reproducing the VCd 1-
              hole-polaron, reconciling theoretical predictions with
              experimental observations. We find the cadmium vacancy

               Optical transitions from defect states can enhance photocurrent
               generation through sub-bandgap absorption; however, these defect
               states are also often responsible for carrier trapping and
