abstract  ="The Shockley–Queisser (SQ) limit provides a convenient metric for predicting light-to-electricity conversion efficiency of a solar cell based on the band gap of the light-absorbing layer. In reality{,} few materials approach this radiative limit. We develop a formalism and computational method to predict the maximum photovoltaic efficiency of imperfect crystals from first principles. The trap-limited conversion efficiency includes equilibrium populations of native defects{,} their carrier-capture coefficients{,} and the associated recombination rates. When applied to kesterite solar cells{,} we reveal an intrinsic limit of 20% for Cu2ZnSnSe4{,} which falls far below the SQ limit of 32%. The effects of atomic substitution and extrinsic doping are studied{,} leading to pathways for an enhanced efficiency of 31%. This approach can be applied to support targeted-materials selection for future solar-energy technologies."}

While the significance for solid electrolytes is well appreciated, there are only a few examples, where defect chemistry is taken seriously for electrode materials. This is astonishing as it is only defect chemistry which allows for a proper understanding of both equilibrium (e.g. theoretical capacity, cell voltage) and non-equilibrium properties (losses due to transport problems, charge-transfer resistance, concentration polarization). Furthermore defect chemistry provides the framework for both a materials analysis and a materials search. Selected examples are discussed which refer to various storage modes, corroborating this statement (FePO4, Li2O2, TiO2, Ru: Li2O).}

  author   = "Neilson, William D and Murphy, Samuel T",
  abstract = "Inevitably, all crystalline materials will contain imperfections
              that have the ability to modify the properties of the host
              material. Key to the development of advanced materials is the
              ability to predict the concentrations of different defects in any
              given environmental conditions and how the change in the defect
              population alters the material's properties. Modern first
              principles atomistic simulation techniques, such as density
              functional theory (DFT), are now widely employed for the
              simulation of point defects, however, to develop true insight
              into a material's defect chemistry, it is essential to link the
              energies calculated to thermodynamic variables that fully
              describe its operating conditions. The Defect Analysis Package
              (DefAP), an open-source Python code, has been designed to fulfil
              this role. The primary function of the package is to predict the
              concentrations of defects in materials as a function of key
              thermodynamic variables, such as temperature and availability of
              different species, expressed through chemical potentials. Through
              simple thermodynamic equations, DefAP allows the rapid
              exploration of a material's defect chemistry allowing direct
              comparison with experimental observations. Rapid exploration is
              supported through the use of autoplotting with carefully
              considered automatic data labelling and simplification options
              enabling production of publication quality plots. DefAP offers a
              wide range of options for the calculation of defect and carrier
              concentrations that can be customised by the user to suit the
              material studied and an extensive suite of options have been
              designed for the study of extrinsic defects (e.g. dopants or
              impurities). The capabilities of DefAP are demonstrated in this
              paper by studying intrinsic defects in YBa2Cu3O7, P doping in Si,
              Am accumulation in PuO2, and simultaneous build-up of T and He in

               on density functional theory. In this work, calculations of
               thermal and charge equilibria among point defects are extended
               to a constant-N approach. The two approaches for point-defect
               equilibria are comparatively demonstrated in the application to
               Mg2Si doped with Li, Na, and Ag, which is a lightweight and

              Spinney is an open-source Python package developed with the aim
              of processing first-principles calculations to obtain several

abstract  ="Alloying is a common technique to optimize the functional properties of materials for thermoelectrics{,} photovoltaics{,} energy storage etc. Designing thermoelectric (TE) alloys is especially challenging because it is a multi-property optimization problem{,} where the properties that contribute to high TE performance are interdependent. In this work{,} we develop a computational framework that combines first-principles calculations with alloy and point defect modeling to identify alloy compositions that optimize the electronic{,} thermal{,} and defect properties. We apply this framework to design n-type Ba2(1−x)Sr2xCdP2 Zintl thermoelectric alloys. Our predictions of the crystallographic properties such as lattice parameters and site disorder are validated with experiments. To optimize the conduction band electronic structure{,} we perform band unfolding to sketch the effective band structures of alloys and find a range of compositions that facilitate band convergence and minimize alloy scattering of electrons. We assess the n-type dopability of the alloys by extending the standard approach for computing point defect energetics in ordered structures. Through the application of this framework{,} we identify an optimal alloy composition range with the desired electronic and thermal transport properties{,} and n-type dopability. Such a computational framework can also be used to design alloys for other functional applications beyond TE."}
