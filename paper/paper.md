# Summary

`py-sc-fermi` is a Python package for calculating point defect concentrations in functional materials under the constraint of net&ndash;charge-neutrality. The required inputs are the formation energies of all defect species in the system and an electronic density of states. These can be obtained obtained from a set of electronic structure calculations (e.g. density functional theory calculations).

Point defects are atomic-scale imperfections in functional materials that strongly influence, for example, electronic structure [@Pastor2022-xa], charge transport [@batteries], and energy conversion processes [@TLC]. Studying the thermodynamics of point defect formation informs of the limits to which we are able to tune materials properties via synthesis conditions and doping strategies [@Yan2015-au; @Squires2019-is; @Park2018-np]. Attempts to quantify the prevalence of different point defects species has become a common practice in materials modelling community with respect to both designing novel, highly efficient electronic materials [@Jackson2022-la; Ganose2018-eu ;@Toriyama2021-ch] and to rationlise and optimise the properties of known materials [@Shimoda2022-vs; @LLZO-elect]. 

The main challenge in calculating point defect populations comes from the fact that point defects carry integer charge but the principle of charge conservation requires that these local integer charges sum to zero over the full defective system. Simply put, the concentrations of all charged point defects are mutually dependent. Stated mathematically,

\begin{equation}
0 = \sum_{X^ùëû} q \[{ùëã^ùëû}\] + n_0 ‚àí p_0
\end{equation}

where the first term is the sum over all the charge contributions from each defect $X$ in each of its accessible charge states $q$ and $n_0$ and $p_0$ are the concentrations of free electrons and holes respectively. All the variables in equation 1 are directly or indirectly functions of the electron chemical potential: the Fermi energy. Under a fixed set of growth conditions, the only unknown variable in the calculation of each term is the Fermi energy, and so the populations of all charged species in the system can be solved for self consistently [@Buckeridge2019-fm].

`py-sc-fermi` provides a numerical approach for the self-consistent solution. An initial Fermi energy is guessed, and this is updated over multiple cycles until the value is found which satisfies charge neutrality (within a specified tolerance). The self-consistent Fermi energy itself can then be used as a general descriptor for the electronic transport properties of the material [@Jackson2022-la]; the calculated concentrations of electronic charge carriers can be used to calculate electronic conductivity and the concentration of the point defects themselves can be used to evaluate the effect of different defect processes on properties of interest [Kavanagh2021-bj; @Ganose2018-eu] and the doping response of the material [@Squires2019-is; @Squires2021-je].

# Statement of need

`py-sc-fermi` is a Python package for determining the self-consistent Fermi energy of a material from knowledge of the point defect
energetics, allowing for quantification of point defect concentrations. While we aware of other scientific software that allows for these and related calculations [@Neilson2022-cj; @Arrigoni2021-oc; @Ogawa2022-sn; @Buckeridge2019-fm], to the best of our knowledge `py-sc-fermi` is unique amongst these in providing all of the following features:

  - it is built on a flexible Python API which allows for rapid prototyping and convergence testing of the solved-for Fermi energy.
  - it is is not part of a larger "point-defects workflow" package, making it as flexible as possible for the end user
  - it is agnostic towards the choice of simulation code used to generate the input data*
  - it possess both command-line functionality for those with little python experience and an object-oriented API that allows the user to construct objects representing individual defects or complete systems of defects directly.
  - it allows for constraints on the concentrations of any combination of defects and specific charge states of that defect, including the simulation of the influence of effective dopants.
  - it is fully documented with good unit-test coverage.

The code has already been used in a number of studies including some focussed on rationalising the 
properties of known materials [@LLZO-elect; @Squires2021-je] and also predicting the properties of novel materials [@Jackson2022-la], in addition, the code can also assist with the visualisation of defect energetics in a flexible manner [@Haouari2021-xz].

One feature in particular we would like to draw attention to is the ability to arbitrarily fix the concentrations of specific defects (or individual defect charge states). For example, if we wish to simulate a system in which defects form at high temperature, but then the system was rapidly cooled to a lower operating temperature such that kinetic barriers were too high for full re-equilibration of some or all defect concentrations, the concentrations of some subset of defects can be fixed and the  system can then be resampled under pseudo-equilbrium lower temperatures allowing for defect properties under a range of different scenarios [@LLZO-elect]. 

*There is some minor convenience functionality for users of the Vienna Ab initio Software Package (VASP).
