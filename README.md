`py-sc-fermi` is a materials modelling code for calculating self-consistent Fermi energies and defect concentrations under thermodynamic equilibrium (or quasi-equilibrium) in the dilute limit given pre-calculated defect formation energies. For the theory, see [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpc.2019.06.017).   

The necessary inputs are (charged) defect formation energies, an (electronic) density of states, and the volume of the unit cell. Having this data, a `DefectSystem` object can be inititalised, from which the self consistent Fermi energy, defect concentrations, defect transition levels and electron and hole concentrations can be calculated. 

Documentation and usage guides can be found [here](https://py-sc-fermi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Contributing

### Bugs reports and feature requests

If you think you've found a bug, please report it on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/bjmorgan/py-sc-fermi/issues).
This is also the place to propose ideas for new features or ask
questions about the design of `py-sc-fermi`.
Poor documentation is considered a bug, but please be as specific as
possible when asking for improvements.

### Code contributions

We welcome help in improving the package with your
external contributions. This is managed through Github pull requests;
for external contributions
[fork and pull](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)
is preferred:

   1. First open an Issue to discuss the proposed contribution. This
      discussion might include how the changes fit `py-sc-fermi` scope and a
      general technical approach.
   2. Make your own project fork and implement the changes
      there.
   3. Open a pull request to merge the changes into the main
      project. A more detailed discussion can take place there before
      the changes are accepted.

## Citing

If you use `py-sc-fermi` in your work, please consider citing the following: 
- the [paper](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.04962) associated with the `py-sc-fermi`
- the [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010465519302048) associated with the FORTRAN code [`SC-Fermi`](https://github.com/jbuckeridge/sc-fermi) on which this code was initially based, which provides an excellent discussion of the underlying theory.
